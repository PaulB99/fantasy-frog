An algorithm to play FPL

First coherent team: 

                  Lloris
              
    Alonso   Pereira   Thomas   Doherty   Boly

            Fernandes (C)    Son

        Martial   Antonio   JimÃ©nez
    
    Bench : 

    Martin   Lundstram   Ritchie   Shelvey   
    
    
    
The second team actually seems worse than the first team (this team is after the inclusion of last year's total points) 
I think it's worth removing this from the equation and building from there.

Second team:

                           De Gea

                Thomas   Gomez   Garcia   Basham

    Aubameyang (C)   Barnes   Henderson   Wilson   Sterling
    
                            Ings

    Bench :

    Fabianski   Stephens   Barnes   Antonio
