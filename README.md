An algorithm to play FPL

First coherent team: 

                  Lloris
              
    Alonso   Pereira   Thomas   Doherty   Boly

            Fernandes (C)    Son

        Martial   Antonio   JimÃ©nez
    
    Bench : 

    Martin   Lundstram   Ritchie   Shelvey   
    
    
    
The second team actually seems worse than the first team (this team is after the inclusion of last year's total points) 
I think it's worth removing this from the equation and building from there.

Second team:

                           De Gea

                Thomas   Gomez   Garcia   Basham

    Aubameyang (C)   Barnes   Henderson   Wilson   Sterling
    
                            Ings

    Bench :

    Fabianski   Stephens   Barnes   Antonio
    
    

After some tinkering around, the issue turned out to be that the players were not in order. After fixing that I came across a new yet expected problem: more than 3 players from one team were selected.

Third team:

                      Alisson 

    Keane   Pereira   Thomas   van Djik   Garcia

          Maddison   Milner   Salah (C)

                  Vardy   Martial
                  
    Bench:
    
    Henderson   Wilson   Anderson   Sharp
